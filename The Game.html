<p id ="para3">Apex legends. This isn't the only game I play but its my favorite. I will play
Fortnite if you ask me to. Ever since battle royale games I stopped playing disk games. 
I really like playing games, it's one of my favorite things to do. Like I said on 
the main screen i play on xbox. I also play on pc, On pc i play tf2 and .io games.
