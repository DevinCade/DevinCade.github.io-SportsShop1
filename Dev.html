    <p id ="para1"> My name is Devin, and I love to play baseball.The postition I play is outfield.
    Outfield is my best and favortie position, but i can pitch. I can play basketball but
    i'm not the best at it,but I will still mess u up. I play on Xbox, because xbox 
    is the best and I don't play fortnite because it is trash now. I grind apex legends 
    because it is better than any other game out there.
    Any questions? No, ok let's go look at my links. </p>
