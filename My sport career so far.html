    <p id ="para2"> Recently as a freshmen I played for McCluer's Jv and freshmen baseball team. 
    I play out field, and i'm very good at what  i do. I can pitch but ground balls 
    aren't my thing so i don't play infield as much. embarrassing, as it is our 
    team only won 1 game BUT i have my highlights.
